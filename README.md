# venture-testing-system
A testing suite I made because my geometry teacher made a mistake in grading

# why
I've been making minecraft plugins for the longest time now and I feel like its probably time to take my skills and make something useful so I decided to make a system like Edulastic which has online tests

# use it?
Definitely not. It is just the backend with no frontend (probably) but its still fun and its a proof of concept.
